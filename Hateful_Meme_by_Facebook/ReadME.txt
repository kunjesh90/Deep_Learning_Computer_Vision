The goal is to predict whether a meme is hateful or non-hateful. 
This is a binary classification problem with multimodal input data consisting of 
the the meme image itself (the image mode) and a string representing the text in the meme image (the text mode).

Given a meme id, meme image file, and a string representing the text in the meme image, 
trained model should output the probability that the meme is hateful.
